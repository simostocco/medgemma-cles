## Research Report: Metformin in Alzheimer's Disease

**1) Question:** Does metformin have beneficial or detrimental effects on Alzheimer's Disease?

**2) Evidence Summary:**

- Epidemiological studies suggest a link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with shared pathological commonalities. [S1]
- Metformin, a commonly prescribed antihyperglycemic agent for T2DM, has been shown to potentially impact AD progression. [S1]
- Metformin may benefit AD by inhibiting amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation through increased activity of IDE and NEP, leading to enhanced Aβ clearance. [S10]
- Studies investigating the long-term effects of metformin on AD have yielded conflicting results, with some suggesting a potential increase in AD risk while others indicate potential benefits. [S10]
- A real-world target trial emulation study using electronic health records of patients with type 2 diabetes in the US showed that semaglutide was associated with a significantly reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia. [S9] 

**3) Biological Rationale:**

- Metformin primarily activates AMPK, which has downstream effects on glucose metabolism and may influence cellular processes relevant to AD pathogenesis. [S4]
- Metformin reduces Aβ aggregation by increasing IDE and NEP activity, ultimately promoting Aβ clearance from the brain. [S10]
- Metformin may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which contribute to neuronal damage in AD. [S4]

**4) Contradictions / Gaps:**

- Conflicting evidence exists regarding the long-term effects of metformin on AD risk, requiring further investigation. [S10]
- Insufficient evidence in provided snippets. + [S4]

**5) Uncertainty & Limitations:**

- Insufficient evidence in provided snippets. + [S10]
- Insufficient evidence in provided snippets. + [S10]
