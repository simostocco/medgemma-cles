## Research Report: Ibuprofen in ALS

**1) Question:** Does Ibuprofen have a potential therapeutic role in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)?

**2) Evidence Summary:**

- Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain and inflammation [S1][S2].
- While NSAIDs like ibuprofen have shown efficacy in reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis [S2], their effectiveness in treating ALS remains unclear. 
- Concurrent blockade of free radicals and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated inflammation, which ibuprofen can achieve, showed promise in a mouse model of ALS [S3].
- [S1]

**3) Biological Rationale:**

- Ibuprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress [S5].
- Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS [S5].
- [S3], [S5]

**4) Contradictions / Gaps:**

- [S2]
- [S4]
- While the AAD-2004 derivative, which blocks both free radicals and PGE2, showed promise in a mouse model [S3], it is not a direct comparison to ibuprofen.

**5) Uncertainty & Limitations:**

- [S6]
- [S7]
- [S8]
